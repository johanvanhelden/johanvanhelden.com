                About Me
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I am a full-stack developer <span class="text-xs">(for some reason full-stack developers are called Unicorns...)</span>
                from the Netherlands and started programming when I was 12 years old.
                The first programming language I learned was <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="link link--primary"
                >Visual Basic</a>. I have always loved bringing my thoughts and ideas to the computer screen.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                After finishing high school I knew that I wanted to make my living by programming. So I choose an "Application Development" study.
                When I completed my internship, I started working full-time making websites and web applications.
                The language I was writing in at the time was
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="link link--primary"
                >ASP Classic</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                ASP Classic; however, was quickly overshadowed by PHP and I decided to switch to that programming language instead.
                In the beginning I was making my own "mini frameworks" for projects I was working on, but quickly switched to
                <a
                    href="https://www.codeigniter.com/"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="link link--primary"
                >CodeIgniter</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Luckily, after a few months, I discovered a framework called <a
                    href="https://laravel.com/"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="link link--primary"
                >Laravel</a>. And up until this day I still use Laravel as my PHP framework of choice.
                It just gives you so much features out of the box, it becomes trivial to quickly set up a proof-of-concept.
                And is also powerful and flexible enough to transform that proof-of-concept in a future-proof, stable and secure application.
